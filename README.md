# HSPPAD143A
HSPPAD143A is the 3.1x3.1mm footprint and 2.6mm height digital interface pressure sensor
designed as waterproof for barometer system and water depth measurement system. Barometric
and water pressure is detected by MEMS sensor element using piezo resistive bridge circuit formed
on the silicon diaphragm. The sensor element is connected to ASIC for signal conditioning. ASIC
has 17-bit ADC and temperature compensation capability. The ASIC output compensated pressure
values. In addition to the compensation, this product supports averaging and filtering for lower noise,
and FIFO function. I2C interface is prepared for communication.

This is my original test program, currently working only in register mode only
